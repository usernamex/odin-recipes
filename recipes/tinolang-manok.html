      Tinolang manok or chicken tinola is a nourishing Filipino chicken soup. It
      can consist of various chicken cuts and internal organs cooked in a
      flavorful broth alongside green papaya and chili pepper or malunggay
      leaves. The broth is usually generously seasoned with ginger, garlic, and
      fish sauce, and the soup is often served over plain white rice.

      Chicken tinola is a staple in every Filipino household and can be enjoyed
      as a starter or a hearty main course.
