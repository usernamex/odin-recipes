    <p>
      This steamed lapu-lapu with mayonnaise has been on my to-do list since
      last Christmas, but I couldn't find fresh grouper big enough for the
      recipe until the holidays passed. Imagine my delight when I finally
      chanced upon ones that are upward of 3 to 5 pounds in size at our
      neighborhood Asian mart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They weren't exactly cheap at $5.99 a pound. I almost choked, coughing up
      twenty-five dollars for my fish at the checkout counter. But, oh my, was
      every morsel worth the stiff price!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're looking for an impressive Noche Buena centerpiece, this Lapu
      Lapu de la Reyna is it! This recipe is an easy way to level up your
      favorite fish into a holiday-worthy dish that's sure to wow your guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The generous smothering of mayo adds a creamy flavor while the array of
      toppings complements the exquisite flavor of the steamed fish, and the
      festive color combination jazzes it up in Christmas style.
